# UniPeek

Provides an interface to examine Unicode characters. 
Useful in case some same-looking letters appear in a Unicode string.

## Installation

- Put `uni-peek` binary in ~/Applications and launch it. 
- An "U"-shaped icon will appear in Tray (upper-right corner), allowing to show/hide main window.
- Enter any string in a text prompt, and character detalization will show

## Known limitations

- This is a proof-of-concept only. No further development is planned.
- Despite using cross-platform tooling, only Mac (darwin/arm64) build is currently provided.
